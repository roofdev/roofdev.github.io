  <h2>A BRIEF BIO</h2>
  <p>Hello.  I am Roof, an indie game developer.  I try my hardest to make new, fun, and original ideas.  On my YouTube Channel, I post coding related videos, ranging from dev logs to random side projects.  In my spare time, I enjoy playing piano, violin, chess, videogames, and chatting with friends.  </p>
  <h2>CURRENT PROJECTS</h2>
  <p>I am currently working on a game nicknamed Weapons.  The main idea behind it is you have to get through a platforming game where your weapon is your character.  You can pick between a bow, sword, axe, and shield and swap weapons during the game.  Although development is slow at the moment because of school, I expect the game could be out by December 2021.</p>
  <h2>TOOLS I USE</h2>
  <p>I mainly program in Python and C#, although I do like to occasionally use other languages such as HTML and CSS, which are the main languages powering this site.  To code, I use a mix of VSCode for non-game related work and Visual Studio and Unity.  I also use Aseprite and Photoshop for most graphics.  To edit my videos, I use Premiere Pro.</p>
